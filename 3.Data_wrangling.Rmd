# Dealing with data

After you collect your raw data, you often need to:

1. tidy data (remove/replace missing data)
2. define outliers and refine your data
3. select subset of your data
4. join different data together
5. summarize your data
6. compute new type of data

# Manipulate data with Tidyverse

* Unlike traditional approach, `tidyverse` use pipes, which is close to our logical processing. 

> Pipe operation: %>%

  Data %>% Operator() %>% Operator() %>% ... -> Results

# Most used operators
  * `filter()` - pick rows based on conditions
  * `select()` - select variables (columns)
  * `group_by()` - group rows of observations together
  * `summarize()` - compute summary measures, such as mean, sd, count etc.
  * `mutate()` - create new variable (column)
  * `arrange()` - sort the data based on a variable
  

> data %>% group_by(condition) %>% summarise(mrt = mean(RT))

# The filter verb

`filter()` select some rows, often for subsecting the data. For example, you may want to filter out error trials and outliers. 

\fig{0.7}{filter.pdf}

# Example

```{r, echo = T}
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>% filter(year == 1952)
```

# Filter with multiple comparision

Multiple arguments (separated by ',') to filter() are combined with 'and'. For other types of combinations, you'll need to use Boolean operators: And(`&`), Or (`|`), Not(`!`)

# Filter - Excercise

- Please select Africa countries from gapminder dataset
- please find Europe countries between years 1950 and 2000

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(continent == 'Europe', year >= 1950 & year <2000)
```


# The arrange verb

`arrange()` sorts a table based on a variable. 

\fig{0.7}{sort.pdf}

# Example: Sorting with arrange

```{r, echo = T}

gapminder %>% arrange(gdpPercap)

```

# Example: Sorting with arrange

* decending using `desc()`

```{r, echo = T}

gapminder %>% arrange(desc(gdpPercap))

```

# The select verb

When you have a lot of variables, you may want to select those variables that you care about. `select()` allows you to do this baesd on the names of the variables. 

```{r, echo = T}
gapminder %>% select(country, continent, year, lifeExp)
```


# The mutate verb

Besides selecting sets of existing columns, it's often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. `mutate()` does this job.

\fig{0.7}{mutate.pdf}

# Using mutate to change a variable

```{r, echo = T}
gapminder %>% mutate(pop = pop/1000000)
```

# Using mutate to add a new variable

```{r, echo = T}
gapminder %>% mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop)
```
# Useful creation functions

- Arithmetic operators: `+, -, *, /, ^`.
- Modular arithmetic `%/%` (integer division), `%%` (remainder)
- logical comparisions:`==`,`!=`, etc. (useful when you create flags for correct trials)
- Offsets: `lead()`, `lag()`  [useful when you want to do inter-trial analysis]
- cumulative and rolling aggregates: `cumsum()`, 'cumprod()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`

# The summarize verb

`summarise()` collapses a data frame to a single row according the statitical function you specify. 

```{r, echo = T}
gapminder %>% 
  summarize(meanlifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

```


# The group_by verb

It is very useful when `summarise()` comes togethers with `group_by()`. 


```{r, echo = T}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year)%>%
  summarize(meanlifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
```

# Excercise

- summarize mean life expectancies for each countries over years
- summarize mean life expectancies for different continents over years
- visualize the above results


# Join tables

Please check the data manipulation cheat sheet. 

* left_join(x,y, by = )
* right_join(x,y, by = )
* inner_join(x,y, by=)
* full_join(x,y, by = )

# Dealing with missing values

Sometimes you may get data with some missing values. Those missing values may cause the above functions to unexpected results. 

> Missing values are "contagious"!

```{r, echo = T}

NA > 5
10 == NA
NA  + 10
NA == NA
```

# Filter out NA values

- `is.na()` determines NA values

```{r, echo = T}
library(nycflights13) # use flights dataset for an example
filter(flights, is.na(dep_delay))
```

# dealing with missing values

Using `flights` dataset, we want to see the departure delay times over the months. Given that `dep_delay` has missing values, we need to filter those missing values first. 

```{r, echo = T}

flights %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay))
```

# dealing with missing values

Alternatively, you can deal with those missing values within the summarising functions. 
Note, each function requires additional parameters `na.rm = TRUE` (i.e., removing NA values)


```{r, echo = T}

flights %>%  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# Excercise

- Calculate average arrival delay time over the months for different carriers

# A general excercise

In the following practice, we will do a full process on data manipulation. The raw data are availabe in our shared github.
